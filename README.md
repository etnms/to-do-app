# To do App 

## You can find a live demo [here].
</br>

# This is a simple To do app made with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The app is written in **plain JS**. With the exception of **Webpack** (module bundler), no third-party library has been used for this project. No front-end framework were used.

</br>
The app uses local storage to save projects. In other words, using it on a different computer will not load projects from a different computer.

##### Storage with Firebase will be added soon.
